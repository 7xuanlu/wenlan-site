  "Hybrid retrieval on libSQL: vector + FTS5 + reciprocal-rank fusion + knowledge-graph context with a CE reranker. LME_Oracle: 93.6% Recall@5, 0.857 MRR, 0.883 NDCG@10 (500 Q). LME_S: 87.7% Recall@5, 0.815 MRR, 0.822 NDCG@10 (deep, N=90). Retrieval uses ~168 tokens per recall query versus full replay at 4,505 tokens per query.",
  "Real git versioning: readable pages, sessions, handoffs, and status artifacts commit into ~/.wenlan/.git/ so Markdown artifacts can be inspected, diffed, reverted, or branched.",
  "LLM wiki for AI work: source-backed wiki page records keep source memory IDs. The daemon rejects pages with empty source_memory_ids (HTTP 422), and pages can grow or refresh without losing their source chain.",
  "Auditable memory: low-confidence captures, contradictions, supersession chains, and protected-memory conflicts surface for review instead of silently entering context.",
  "Composition over storage: memories distill into pages. Sessions track workflow. An entity graph links people, projects, tools, and relations. ~30 MCP tools across one daemon, not 100+ skills bolted on.",
  "Explicit spaces: tag memories, pages, and recalls with space=work | personal | client-X. Auto-detected from current repo or workspace.",
  "Cross-platform daemon: current prebuilt runtime artifacts cover macOS Apple Silicon, Linux x86_64/aarch64 glibc, and Windows x86_64. macOS Intel is source/dev-only until a public release workflow publishes that artifact again.",
  "Optional desktop app: a Tauri 2 + React 19 source-cited wiki GUI in github.com/7xuanlu/wenlan-app (AGPL-3.0-only). It talks to the same local daemon over HTTP at localhost:7878, carries its bundled daemon pin in .wenlan-backend-version, and provides guided Remote Access for ChatGPT and Claude.ai. Remote Access uses --no-auth behind a temporary HTTPS tunnel, so possession of the URL grants access.",
  "Client surfaces: Claude Code and Codex plugins, local MCP for Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, Gemini CLI, and other clients, plus Streamable HTTP MCP for ChatGPT and Claude.ai.",
  "No cloud sync or telemetry by default. Local models and Anthropic keys are opt-in for automatic page distillation, recaps, and richer graph work.",
  "Markdown artifacts you can read: pages in ~/.wenlan/pages/, session logs and project status under ~/.wenlan/sessions/. Symlink into Obsidian.",
